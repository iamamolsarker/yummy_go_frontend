To display screenshots in the main README, add your images to this folder with the following names:

### Required Files:

### Tips for Best Results:

- Ensure images are clear and high-resolution
- Take full-width screenshots for better visibility
- Compress images if they're over 500KB (use tools like TinyPNG)
